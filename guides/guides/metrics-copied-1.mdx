title: "Exclude Pages"
---

You may wish to exclude pages or multiple pages being tracked. This is useful for things like `/admin` pages or `/settings` that you won't find as useful metrics to measure.

1. Navigate to your [website settings](https://averfo.com/websites).
1. Click the `Shields` tab.
1. Start typing in the path you would like to exclude. We will list already tracked pages to make it easier.
1. If you would like to use a wildcard, add `*` at the end. For example, you may wish to exclude all `/blog` pages. Simply enter, `/blog*` and any pages under that slug will be discarded from this point forward.
1. If events have already entered Averfo before adding your exclusions, they will still appear in the dashboard. If you would like these removed, finish your exclusion list and [get in touch](mailto:support@averfo.com) with support to request deletion.
