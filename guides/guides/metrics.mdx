## What Metrics Averfo Collects (and What We Don’t)

At **Averfo**, we take a strict **data-minimisation approach**: we collect **only what is necessary** to provide meaningful analytics — and nothing more.

Below is a transparent breakdown of what Averfo **does and does not collect** from your website visitors, and why.

## Our Privacy Principles

- No cookies. Ever.
- No IP addresses (not stored, not hashed).
- No fingerprinting or cross-site tracking.
- No tracking across sessions or websites.
- Fully GDPR- and ePrivacy-friendly by default.
- No cookie consent banners required.

## Cookies & Similar Technologies

###  ❌ We do **not** use cookies

Averfo does **not** set cookies or use similar storage technologies, including:

- Cookies (first-party or third-party)
- Local storage
- Session storage
- Browser fingerprinting
- IP address hashing

These technologies are commonly used to track users across pages or visits. We intentionally avoid them to protect visitor privacy.

## IP Addresses

###  ❌ We do **not** collect or store IP addresses

IP addresses are dropped immediately and are **never**:

- Stored
- Logged
- Hashed
- Used for analytics
- Used for geolocation

Requests are processed without retaining IP data, ensuring visitors cannot be identified — even indirectly.

## Unique Page Views

###  ✅ We detect **unique views**, without cookies or IPs

We measure whether a page view is _unique_ without identifying visitors.

Instead of cookies or IP addresses, Averfo determines uniqueness using **referrer domain logic**:

- If a visitor navigates within the same site, the view is considered **non-unique**
- If a visitor arrives from a different domain, it is considered **unique**

This approach avoids personal data entirely while still providing accurate visit metrics.

## Timestamps

###  ✅ We collect timestamps

We store timestamps to generate time-based analytics such as:

- Hourly trends
- Daily and monthly graphs
- Performance comparisons over time

Timestamps are not tied to individuals and are used solely for aggregated reporting.

## User Agents

###  ✅ We collect **anonymised** user agents

User agents help us:

- Detect and exclude bots and crawlers
- Count browsers and device types

We **do not** use user agents for fingerprinting.

As an extra anonymization we:

- Make sure detailed version numbers are truncated
- Long numeric identifiers are replaced with zeros

## Country

### ✅ We collect country-level data (without IPs)

Instead of IP-based geolocation, Averfo determines country using the visitor’s **time zone**.

This method:

- Avoids IP address usage entirely
- Identifies country only (no city or region)
- Automatically updates when devices change location

## URLs

###  ✅ We partially store URLs

We store only the essential parts of a URL:

- Protocol `https`)
- Hostname `example.com`)
- Path `/page`)

We **do not store**:

- Query parameters
- Fragments `#`)
- Search terms or identifiers

**Example:**

`https://example.com/page?search=test#top`

**Stored as:**

`/page`

## Referrers

###  ✅ We partially store referrers

Referrers help answer: _“Where did this visitor come from?”_

**We collect:**

- Referrer domains (stored using the same partial URL logic)

This allows you to see traffic sources without exposing personal data.

## Time on Page

### ✅ We measure time on page

We track how long a page is actively viewed:

- Time is counted only when the page is visible
- Background or hidden tabs are excluded

This provides more accurate engagement metrics.

## Summary

Averfo proves that **useful analytics do not require invasive tracking**.

**We collect:**

- Only what’s needed
- Only in aggregated form
- Without cookies, IPs, or identifiers

**And we don’t collect:**

- Personal data of visitors
- Cross-site tracking signals
- Persistent identifiers
