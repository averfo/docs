Events allow you to track moments when a user is on your website. For example; clicking a signup button or loading from an advert.

Averfo makes it simple to setup, but first, you must setup the custom event under `Website Settings`

1. Navigate to your `Website Settings` - Find under your [website](https://averfo.test/websites) page.
2. Click `Events`.
3. Press the`Create event` button.
4. Add your `Event Name` - E.g; `Signup` and save.

## Triggering Events

To trigger an event, you must call it via a small Javascript script - don't worry, it's pretty simple!

1. First, make sure you have [Installed Averfo](/guides/guides/install-averfo) successfully on your site and is called in the `head` of your website before the scripts below.
2. Find your `<footer>`, closing `</body>` tag or `script manager` if you are using a CMS platform.
3. Add in the following script:

   ```javascript button_click_event.js
   <script>
     document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
   	//Make sure to have a button with id="signup_btn"
       var signupBtn = document.getElementById('signup_btn');
   
       signupBtn.addEventListener('click', function () {
         sendEvent('Signup');
       });
     });
   </script>
   ```
4. Now try and click the button and watch your events tracking within the Averfo website dashboard.
5. Once you see events coming in. It's time to setup Goal funnels for further analysis and reporting.
